            <a name="aggressive"><h3>Dobermans are Aggressive</h3></a>
            <p>
                This is a very common misconeption among those unfamiliar with the breed. Dobermans have this reputation
                from a long history of being bred as guard dogs and trained to attack and be particularly protective.
                They were originally bred in Germany during WW2 to have a dog that would protect, kill and intimidate
                your enemies, which is one reason the ears were done and the tails were cropped. They looked fierce.
                This has not been true for a long time, as breeders it's our job to make sure the customer gets what they
                want and that we breed responsibly. This means that we only take Dobermans that have had a complete health
                exam, that can pass a behavior test, their lines can be traced back 5 generations at least, and less important
                have some kind of show or agility awards.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has been true with breeders for some time now as we do not want to breed undesirable traits, so
                the end result is a Doberman that is more well behaved than your lab. You can rest assured that your
                new Doberman will not attack, maim or lash out at you or anyone else for that matter.

            <a name="kids"><h3>Dobermans and Kids</h3></a>
            <p>
                If you have children and are considering purchasing a doberman then you will have no worries about
                the dogs attitude towards the children. First, our Dobermans are raised around children and second they
                are very mild mannered and tolerant when it comes to children and actually any human. They get excited
                to see people, kids and anyone because it means they get to play, which they love to do.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <a name="cropped"><h3>Tails Cropped or Not</h3></a>
            <p>
                We normally crop our Dobermans tails before you even get to see them because it is best to do before
                they are six months old. However, if you do not want their tail cropped you can request that ahead of time
                and we will make sure your wishes are met. When we get agility dogs in then we don't crop their tail unless
                requested because they use their tail as a rudder to keep them quick and agile.
            </p>
            <p>
                So if you are thinking to crop or not it is a personal decision, it doesn't hurt the dogs in anyway as we
                do it surgically under anesthesia and it heals very quickly.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <a name="ears"><h3>Ears Cut and Shaped</h3></a>
            <p>
                This is definitely something that is a personal choice, a lot of veterinarians won't do the procedure
                anymore. When we first started breeding we had our dobermans ears done and we had to drive quite a ways
                to find someone willing to do it and I finally understood why. It is really a painful and traumatic event
                for the dog, and since it does not help in any way whatsoever. So, like my mistake with my very first
                Doberman I cropped his ears because it was the look that I wanted, and I vowed to never do it again.
                It is six months of torture for the dog, having to change the bandages every few days and clean the
                area so it doesn't get infected, it traumatizes the animal and they never forget it.
            </p>
            <p>
                To show the temperament of Dobermans the whole time we took care of his ears no matter how much it hurt he
                never once lashed out at us and he still loves us and is loyal today even though we put him through that
                torture when he was little. So the choice is yours, but we will not do the ears nor do we know anyone in the area
                that does that procedure.
            </p>

            <a name="you"><h3>What We Do For You</h3></a>
            <p>
                We have Dobermans on site at all times and you are more than welcome to come and see them, play with
                them and just get to know the breed. We have and provide the lineage of each dog that comes and goes
                through our facility. Like I stated earlier, we do crop the tails for you unless otherwise instructed.
                We send them to you with all their first shots and check ups. We provide our contact information in case
                you have any questions or concerns with your Doberman. We provide you with information and forms to register
                your dog with the AKC which also comes with some nice benefits as far as medical and tracking options in
                case your dog gets lost or stolen.
            </p>
