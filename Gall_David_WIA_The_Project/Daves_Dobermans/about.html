        <p>
            We have been in business since 1978 and have bred Dobermans that have won many titles in show and agility
            competitions. We have bred them as family pets and as disability dogs. So we have a wide variety of fields
            our dogs go into, but the most important one is that no matter what field they go into they always remain
            a part of that family for life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back when we started this business the first few years were tough because of the image that movies, television
            and people in general were getting out to the public. What kind of dogs kills the criminal in Thunderbolt and
            Lightfoot with Clint Eastwood? That's right two Dobermans guarding a department store. This is the way the breed
            was brought to the public, so in order to change peoples perception of this magnificent animal we began our
            crusade. It took some teaching and some public awareness campaigns but eventually folks began to see the light
            and the "fresh" start for the Doberman was upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we got the message out and people started coming to see the dogs things started to change almost instantly.
            We began to see families come in day after day and it was hard to keep up with the demand. The most popular trait
            people were attracted to was the Dobermans intelligence, which in a sense can be their worst trait also. By that I mean
            they will figure out ways to outsmart you to get what they want. Take as an example our first Doberman, he learned
            that if he could distract me from what I was doing (and he was quick enough) he could grab my food. Which is
            to say he would run to the window barking or go grab trash out of the trash can or something of that nature,
            and as soon as you went to look or take care of the issue he would sneak behind you (he was watching out of
            the corner of his eye the whole time) and take what he wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally they are very awkward when they are puppies growing up and people get concerned that their dog is not
            all there, but rest assured your dog is just getting used to his/her body as it grows in different stages. More
            specifically the legs are long and lanky and their body is pretty robust for those legs so they can be very clumsy
            throughout the first year of their lives.
